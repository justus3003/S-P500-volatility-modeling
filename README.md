# S-P500-volatility-modeling
This repository contains an R-based pipeline for analyzing the realized volatility of the S&amp;P 500 index using the GARCH-MIDAS framework. The project pulls data from the FRED API, processes daily returns, constructs realized volatility measures, and estimates a GARCH-MIDAS model to capture both short- and long-term components of market volatility.
